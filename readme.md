Please fork the repo, do not commit here. Once cloned, use your favorite git tool to merge 'branch' into 'main'. Resolve the conflict so you end up with the revision of main (tip) and line3 of the branch named 'branch'. 

The exercise should take less than 5 min, including the fork clone and commit and push of the conflict-free merged main branch.
